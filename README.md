About Camera Traps:
The dataset consists of 5000 images from the CalTech Camera Traps dataset, which is a large dataset with 243,187 images from 140 camera locations.  Camera traps are motion- or heat-triggered cameras that are placed in locations of interest by biologists in order to monitor and study animal populations and behavior. 
These camera traps provide large amounts of data and information that can be very helpful and insightful to biologists. However, the time, effort, and resources it takes for biologists to look through these camera photos, remove empty frames, and classify these images limits research productivity. An important solution is using computer vision to automate this process.

For the research project, 
I wanted to research and evaluate the ability of different machine learning models to generalize to new locations. If we optimize these models to be able to generalize to new locations using labeled examples from only a few locations, then scientists will not have to create new labeled data for each new location a camera trap is placed and their work can be minimized.

I tested three different models: a decision tree model, a K-Nearest Neighbors model (where k=2), and a neural network.
